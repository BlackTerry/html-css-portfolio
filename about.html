        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <p id="quote">I am a second year IT student studying Systems
            Development at Boston City Campus & Business
            College. I have a great interest in computers
            and the software they run, I started learning 
            about coding back in high school. I learn't how
            to use HTML and CSS, after learning those two,
            I heard about Javascript, a language that would
            make my static websites more interesting. As expected,
            Javascript was hard, so instead of learning Javascript,
            I learn't other web development languages/frameworks such
            as NodeJs, ExpressJs and ReactJs. I found all three
            of these to be quite easy and interesting. At the time of
            writing this, I have learn't other languages, frameworks
            and database languages. I have learn't how to use Java, Python,
            MySQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, ReactJs, NodeJs,
            ExpressJs and recently I have started to learn the SpringBoot
            framework.</p>
